# üí™ Goals

Ghent Theft Auto's main goal is **exploring the application of videogame technologies towards visualising and simulating the city of Ghent.**

It serves as a versatile testbed for visualising all kinds of data in a 3D environment that is the home of 260.000 residents, each with their own particular lives and activities, accurate to the centimeter.

Possible applications of Ghent Theft Auto are the combination of:

- visualisation of live geodata, using [Location](https://www.notion.so/Location-acc1b1a8fa404b2e8cbba85d035f24f5?pvs=21)
- visualisation of web served tilemaps, LiDAR
- visualisation of simulations such as crowd simulations, fluid simulations, etc.
- visualisation of real time crowds, using signals from people‚Äôs mobile devices
- visualisation of urban processes such as public transport
- visualizing machine learning inside a 3D environment
- rendering a complete city in realtime, even on low-end hardware as VR or mobile
- providing a starter kit for real world location games
- providing people with the tools so that Ghent Theft Auto can build itself
- actually simulate 270.000 citizens living inside the game world
- provide OSM spawnable data for all tiles present in the huge Gent in 3D set
- retrieve build date from GRB for every building mesh/address in the map
- every Ghent building should be destructible üòª

The scope of Ghent Theft Auto _could_ theoretically be expanded to the complete territory of Belgium, even the world.

But that's for the next guy. üëç
