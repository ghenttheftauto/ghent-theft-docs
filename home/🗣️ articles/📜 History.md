# ðŸ“œ History

Ghent Theft Auto has been my _monster pet project_ since somewhere around 2013.

The project originated as a GTA:IV mod but as my skills progressed, it has since turned into an application that uses a more accessible game engine. In this case, Unity.

During my failed Architecture studies, I wanted to show a design of mine inside of a game engine. I knew it was possible because there are tons of mods available for a vast array of games, every single on of them basically altering the game to the will of the mod creator.
