# 🐺 The Steppe

Ever since I read this [VRT article](https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2025/03/10/gent-archeologie-prehistorie-geschiedenis-sint-baafskathedraal-o/) about deep soil drilling beneath the Saint Bavo cathedral, I've been thinking about the [Steppe](xref:Life.Steppe). 🐺🌙🦬

This triggered me to 'tick the game loop back to 18,000 BCE to pre-cook the simulation and all it's souls', not just as a technical gimmick but as an act of reverence.

The tundra beneath Sint-Baafskathedraal remembers. We know we can do it since we fixed [Easter](easter.md) with Metonic cycles and Epacts. We just need more maths, bigger numbers and possibly more balls, than the monks did in 500AD.

In the simulation, every living human is tied to a Soul. These are not erased upon death—they return to the Steppe. A `static` list of 227,000 souls forms the canonical registry, passed around like candle flames between vessels. You can invoke the GC on a [IVessel](xref:Humans.IVessel), but the Soul `struct` is `readonly`.
