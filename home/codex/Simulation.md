# Simulation

> Simulations are techniques in which a real-life systems or processes are emulated by a designed model.

Simulation systems are **big** systems, coupling components into bigger processes.

Ghent Theft Auto draws inspiration from the concept of a digital twin, and comes with some very lofty goals:

- Simulate the actual amount of humans inside the city at all times, every one of them with a full history and relations (260.000 entitites)
- Simulate the progression of history and time backwards and forwards
- combines [[👤 Human]] and [[⏳ Time]] to give the appearance of an actual life inside the city.
- [[🚦 TrafficSystem]] takes [[OSM]] and builds a traffic system for people to move along from and towards their various destinations.
- The simulation combines Location and [[💼 Profession]] in order to simulate activity and labour of citizens.
- Simulate the generation and consumption of [[⚡️Power]] on the network by producers and consumers.

Since simulating relationships backwards and forwards into time can quickly spiral out of control, at first we’re approaching the Life simulation very individualistic.

Citizens aren’t born from parents. They just get born in a [[🏥 Hospital]].

They don’t meet anybody, live alone their whole life and die alone 😜

Another weird reprecussion on the vision of Ghent Theft Auto will be the ability to ‘undie’ a person, i.e. starting it out really old and turning the gears of life backwards, like de-retiring and de-educating.

With these two out of the way, and a lot more incoming, let’s get started and take a look at a regular life inside Ghent Theft Auto.
