# Healthcare

# NPC

In Ghent Theft Auto, citizens who are in need of medical assistance are healed or revived by a [[👩‍⚕️ Doctor]], usually working at a Doctor Residence or in a [[🏥 Hospital]]

## Birth

[[🏥 Hospital]] also serve as the [[🤰 Birthplace]] of all citizens, player controlled or NPC.

## Death

When a Player's health reaches zero, he/she dies. Their UI displays WASTED and the location they died at. NPC's that die of old age will sometimes do so after being transferred to a [[👤 Human]]

## Reviving

When a Player dies, the following message should be displayed to their UI.

> You have **[death method]** at **[last_known_address]**. A nearby doctor **[doctor_name]** at **[doctor_address]** wants to revive you.

When the Player accepts, he/she is transported to the doctor address and a sum of Money is withdrawn from their Wallet.
