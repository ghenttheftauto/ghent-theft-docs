# Parking

By using [Open Data Gent](https://www.notion.so/Open-Data-Gent-64cb9944aeb44eebba264cbc2f2dac8d?pvs=21) API's, we can show real-time parking occupancy data inside Ghent Theft Auto for [[🅿️ Parking location]] entities inside the World.

The parking occupancy data is updated in real-time, every minute.

If a [[🅿️ Parking location]] closes during the night, it subscribes to the [[⏳ Time]] system.
