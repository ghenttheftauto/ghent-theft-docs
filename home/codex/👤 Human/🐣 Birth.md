[[👤 Human]] are born all over the place but most of the time it's at a [[🏥 Hospital]], carried out by a [[👩‍⚕️ Doctor]]. Most births come from a [[💍 Marriage]].

They are assigned a name based on their gender expressed as [[🙋‍♂️ Male]] or [[🙋‍♀️ Female]].

As stated before, for sanity, citizens have no particular relations with anybody. They have no parents and will own a house from the day they are born.

Actually, after spending their first year at the hospital, they move in to their place at the age of 1.

Individuals involved in a relationship can have a child after a time that distributes by an exponential function with parameter λ= 8 years.

A woman can get pregnant if she has an age that follows a normal (bell-shaped) distribution function with parameters µ = 28 and σ2 = 8 years.

Every woman has a number of children that distributes by a normal function with parameters µ = 2and σ2 = 6 years. (The parameter µ represents the average age while σ2 is the measure of age variability.)
