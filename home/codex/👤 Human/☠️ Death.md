# Death

The poor [[👤 Human]]. Destined to die when their time is come.

Mortality rates are included in the project and a dice is rolled yearly for each alive human in the population in order to asses if and when they should die.

When they die, humans are not removed from memory, in order to reverse and even extend Life in the opposite direction.

A [[🧙‍♂️ Priest]] is scheduled to bid them farewell.
