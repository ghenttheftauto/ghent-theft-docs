Welcome to the simulation, [Human](xref:Domain.Humans.Human).

- ### 🧠 Domain-Driven Architecture

  Fully modular simulation engine with dedicated systems for [Education](xref:Domain.Education),[Locations](xref:Domain.Locations), [Profession](xref:Domain.Profession), [Gods](xref:Domain.Gods), [Moments](xref:Domain.Moments), and more.

- ### 🕰️ DateTime-Driven Emergent Behavior

  Each day, the simulation clock ticks — driving events like unpaid [Holiday](xref:Domain.Time.Holiday), school attendance, and the march toward [Death](xref:Domain.Moments.DeathMoment).

  Sacred breaks and civic holidays? We got 'em.

  From [Easter Sunday to Pinkstermaandag](xref:Domain.Time.Calendar), this temporal core governs academic years, school vacations, and divine feast days alike.

  All the while, the [Clock](xref:Domain.Time.Clock) keeps ticking — orchestrating the emergence of life’s rhythms.

- ### 🌅 Halal Easter Calculator

  A totally unhinged, fully halal, and vaguely canonical [Easter calculation](xref:Domain.Gods.Religion) — just as ordained by the Council of Nicaea in 325-whatever.

  For all your sacred scheduling needs, from Ash Wednesday to Corpus Christi.

- ### 🍆 Static Sex Class

  Absolutely cursed. You are gonna click [this](xref:Domain.Gods.Sex), you already know it.
