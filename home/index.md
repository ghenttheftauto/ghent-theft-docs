Welcome to the simulation, [Human](xref:Humans.Human).

## Overview

- [Codex](codex/simulation.md) - Story driven development
- [API Reference](api/index.md) - Auto-generated API documentation
- [Articles](articles/index.md) - Longer form content
- [UI](ui/index.md) - Various UI design systems

### ✨ Highlights

- #### 🌐 The Vision

  For design philosophy and guiding principles, see the
  [Vision Doc](articles/vision.md).

- #### 🛠️ Never not working

  For ongoing tasks and manic unsurmountable tasks for mere mortals, check the [To-Do List](articles/to-dos.md).

- #### 🧠 Domain-Driven Architecture

  Fully modular simulation engine with dedicated systems for
  [Education](xref:Education), [Locations](xref:Locations), [Work](xref:Work),
  [Gods](xref:Gods), [Moments](xref:Moments), and more.

- #### 🕰️ DateTime-driven Emergent Behavior

  Each day, the simulation clock ticks — driving events like unpaid
  [Holiday](xref:Time.Holiday), school attendance with intermittent realistic
  [school breaks](xref:Education.SchoolBreakTypes), and the inevitable march
  toward [Death](xref:Moments.DeathMoment) ☠️.

  Don't be sad, the [Steppe](xref:Steppe.Steppe) is always there.

  Sacred breaks and civic holidays? We got 'em. From
  [Easter Sunday to Pinkstermaandag](xref:Time.Calendar), this temporal core
  governs academic years, school vacations, and divine feast days alike.

  All the while, the [Clock](xref:Time.Clock) keeps ticking — orchestrating the
  emergence of life’s rhythms.

- #### 🌅 Halal Easter Calculator

  A totally unhinged, fully halal, and vaguely canonical
  [Easter calculation](xref:Time) — just as ordained by the Council of
  Nicaea in 325-whatever.

  For all your sacred scheduling needs, from Ash Wednesday to Corpus Christi.

- #### 🍆 Static Sex Class

  Absolutely cursed. You are gonna click [this](xref:Deities.Sex), you already know
  it.
