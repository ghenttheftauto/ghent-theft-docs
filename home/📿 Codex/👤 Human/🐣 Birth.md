# Birth

[[👤 Human]] are born all over the place but most of the time it's at a
[[🏥 Hospital]], carried out by a [[👩‍⚕️ Doctor]], resulting in a [[🤰 Birthplace]] log on the human and the location itself.

Most births come from a [[💍 Marriage]] but you never know!

Babies are assigned a name based on their gender expressed as [[🙋‍♂️ Male]] or
[[🙋‍♀️ Female]].

After spending some time at the hospital with their mother, humans move in to their
residence.

Individuals involved in a relationship can have a child after a time that
distributes by an exponential function with parameter λ= 8 years.

A woman can get pregnant if she has an age that follows a normal (bell-shaped)
distribution function with parameters µ = 28 and σ2 = 8 years.

Every woman has a number of children that distributes by a normal function with
parameters µ = 2and σ2 = 6 years. (The parameter µ represents the average age
while σ2 is the measure of age variability.)
