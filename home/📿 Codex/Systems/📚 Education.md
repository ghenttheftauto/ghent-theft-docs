# Education

In Ghent Theft Auto, citizens who have their fifth birthday in the currently
simulated year are automatically enrolled into their first profession: the
[[👩‍🎓 Student]] profession.

Being a student is practically the same thing as being a [[👩‍🏫 Teacher]]: it
basically means you have to show up at your [[💼 Workplace]] every weekday. Yes,
students also work at schools.

[[👩‍🎓 Student]] and [[👩‍🏫 Teacher]] don't follow the rest of the citizens when it
comes to [[👒 Holidays]].

Instead, they get way more, in the form of school breaks.

Citizens who graduate a certain EducationLevel can graduate into a
[[👩‍🏫 Teacher]].

A student’s progression through this system is tightly coupled to the difficulty
of the SchoolLevel and his/her stats.

[[🍎 Primary School]]

Primary school starts in the calendar year the [[👤 Human]] becomes 5 years old.

From then on, citizens have a chance of flunking the education progress based on
their Intelligence and the EducationLevel.

Correspondingly, flunking your first year of primary school will be harder than
passing your last year of secondary school. Each time you fail a year of
education, it gets easier.

Primary school lasts six years if all goes well.

After graduating the sixth year of primary, the citizen goes out and looks for a
secondary school.

[[🏫 Secondary School]]

The EducationLevel SecondarySchool follows after graduating the sixth year of
primary school and is mandatory up to the age of 16. Generally speaking,
secondary school is exactly the same as primary school. Even the duration is the
same, six years if all goes well.

The main difference being that secondary school is a bit harder and more
importantly: starting at the age of sixteen and increasing rapidly each flunk,
the [[👤 Human]] will have a chance of dropping out of the Education system
entirely and picking up a [[💼 Profession]].

[[🏫 College]]

College is like university light

You can still get a university degree after your college degree through magic
called: schakeltraject.

[[🎓 University]]

Every calendar year on the last day of June, a Student can either advance a
year, flunk a year, or dropout entirely.
